2. Docker: 
	1) What is docker and why do we need it? 
		Docker is containerization tool which used to deploy any kind of application on any host operating system.
		Docker has two main components docker d and docker cli,inside docker d container d is service which can be use
		to manage creation of container n deletion of container which can be access by docker cli. 
		
		Docker simplifies the development and deployment of applications, promotes consistency across environments,
		enhances scalability and efficiency, and supports modern software development practices like DevOps and microservices 				architecture.
	2) Write a docker file for a sample Java/python application. 
	   simple flask app 
	   sample code for flask app
		
		from flask import Flask

		app = Flask(__name__)

		@app.route('/')
		def hello():
    			return 'Hello, World! This is my Flask app.'

		if __name__ == '__main__':
    
    		app.run(host='0.0.0.0', port=8000, debug=True)

		-----------------------------------------------------------------

		DockerFile for flask app

		FROM python:3.9          ---> Base image

		WORKDIR app/             ---> working directory inside container

		COPY  app.py .           ---> copy's code from this directory 

		RUN pip install flask    ---> This will install flask library n add layer on a container

		CMD ["python","app.py"]  ---> This will run command while running the container

		___________________________________________________________________________
		docker build . -t flask:latest
		docker run -d -p 8000:8000 flask:latest
		
	3)  What is the docker lifecycle?
		The Docker lifecycle involves creating Docker images, running containers from those images, managing container resources, 			interacting with containers, and eventually stopping and removing containers when they are no longer needed.

	4) What is the difference between an image and a container? 
	   An image is a read-only template that contains all the instructions and dependencies needed to create a Docker container.
	   
	   A container is a runnable instance of a Docker image.

	5) How to check docker container logs? Provide the command for the same
		docker logs container_id
